<p style="font-size:16px">The COVID-19 Pandemic began due to the emergence of a novel strain of the coronavirus coined "Sars-Cov-2" which emerged in late 2019 in Wuhan City in the Hubei Province of China. The virus quickly spread and affected the entire world in just a few short months. The Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University has been collecting daily time-series data of cases in every part of the world in 'csv' format available <a href="https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19">here</a>. In this project, I used Pandas, a popular Python data analysis library, to manipulate and work with the large dataset and then implemented Matplotlib, a Python graphing library, to visualize the data and animate it as a bar chart that changes over time. The graph focuses on the highest number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in the top 6 countries affected from the time of the first case in the US (Jan 22, 2020) to mid-June 2020. </p>
