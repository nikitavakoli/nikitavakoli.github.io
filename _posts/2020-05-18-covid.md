<p style="font-size:16px">The COVID-19 Pandemic began due to the emergence of a novel strain of the coronavirus coined "Sars-Cov-2" which emerged in late 2019 in Wuhan City in the Hubei Province of China. The virus quickly spread and affected the entire world in just a few short months. The Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University has been collecting daily time-series data of cases in every part of the world in 'csv' format available <a href="https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19">here</a>.
<br>
In this project, I used <strong>Pandas</strong>, a popular Python data analysis library, to manipulate and work with the large dataset and then implemented <strong>Matplotlib</strong>, a Python graphing library, to visualize the data and animate it as a bar chart that changes for each date since the start of the pandemic. The graph focuses on the highest number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in the top 10 countries globally affected from January 22, 2020 to February 27, 2021. This animation is an engaging way to convey the global pandemic and is vital in being able to visualize the severity and rapid spread of the COVID-19 virus.
