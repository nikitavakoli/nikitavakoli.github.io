<p style="font-size:16px"> An issue that is talked about frequently in STEM is the lack of female participation that we constantly see conveyed through copious amounts of data. Why is this, and how can we address it? Well, this is an extremely complex question and problem that's been addressed for several decades, and it's really difficult to communicate in a relatively brief blog post, but I will talk about some of the main points in the SETM gender gap.</p>

<p style="font-size:16px"> First, let's take a quick look at the history of women in STEM.  According to the <a href="https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2021/01/women-making-gains-in-stem-occupations-but-still-underrepresented.html#:~:text=Some%20STEM%20Occupations-,In%201970%2C%20women%20made%20up%2038%25%20of%20all%20U.S%20workers,up%2048%25%20of%20all%20workers.&text=But%20social%20science%20accounted%20for,1970%20to%2015%25%20in%202019">US Census</a>, females held just 8% of all STEM jobs/career in the year 1970; this increased to a much higher 27% in 2019.  Interestingly, the data below shows women participation increasing even more drastically specifically in Mathematics and the Physical Sciences, while Engineering and Computer-related work still remains relatively low through 2019. Overall, there is substantial  developments, but there is still a long way to go to equalize these numbers. Another important data visualization that the census data shows is the inherent pay gap between men and women when it mainly comes to Engineering-related jobs. A statistical significance is shown in almost all of the listed careers which is alarming. Even a study by <a href="https://news.yale.edu/2012/09/24/scientists-not-immune-gender-bias-yale-study-shows"> Yale </a> showed that two identical résumés that were reviewed (with the only difference being the names of a man vs. a woman) produced higher marks in the man's profile and reviewers were more likely to hire him over the female.</p>

<p style="font-size:16px"> Looking more generally into this issue present in the US, data from <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1116527/share-women-stem-country/">Statista</a> shows that around the world, there actually seems to be higher female STEM representation in certain countries and regions. For example, there is a high burst of women working in STEM-related fields in the Middle East and South Asia. This can be analyzed through different perspectives; for example, it may be such that women in these areas are trying harder to counteract the lack of gender equity while women in the US are pursuing other fields since there a cultural disparity is not as evident. This perspective, however, is frequently refuted because of data that indicates women, on average, make less compared to men working in the same fields, namely engineering. Therefore, this results in women gravitating towards other fields such as the arts and social sciences where pay rates seem to be more equitable. Even though the cultural pressure to rebel against the inequity/opportunity of women is not present in the US, the inherent stereotypes <i> are </i>.</p>

<p style="font-size:16px"> It’s also noteworthy that this continued lack of participation in STEM also causes an unintentional “positive” feedback loop where females constantly feel elevated levels of imposter syndrome about competing inside of the classroom with the increased number of males. For example, some will choose not to join those fields, but those who do may also drop out if they’re not performing towards the top of the class.  </p>
