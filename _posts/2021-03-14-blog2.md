<p style="font-size:16px"> An issue that is talked about frequently in STEM is the lack of female participation that we constantly see conveyed through copious amounts of data. Why is this, and how can we address it? That’s what I’m going to talk address in this blog post, because this is a really important issue that the United States should continuously work on improving.</p>

<p style="font-size:16px"> According to the <a href="https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2021/01/women-making-gains-in-stem-occupations-but-still-underrepresented.html#:~:text=Some%20STEM%20Occupations-,In%201970%2C%20women%20made%20up%2038%25%20of%20all%20U.S%20workers,up%2048%25%20of%20all%20workers.&text=But%20social%20science%20accounted%20for,1970%20to%2015%25%20in%202019">US Census</a>, females held 8% of all STEM jobs/career in the year 1970; this increased to 27% in 2019. Interestingly, the data below shows women participation increasing even more drastically specifically in Mathematics and Physical Sciences, while Engineering and Computer-related work still remains relatively low through 2019. Overall, there is substantial  developments, but there is still a long way to go to equalize these numbers.</p>

<p style="font-size:16px"> Looking more deeply into this, data from <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1116527/share-women-stem-country/">Statista</a> shows that around the world, there seems to be higher female STEM representation in certain countries and regions. For example, there is a high burst of women working in STEM-related fields in the Middle East and South Asia. This can be analyzed through different perspectives; for example, it may be such that women in these areas are trying harder to counteract the lack of gender equity while women in the US are pursuing other fields since there a cultural disparity is not as evident. This perspective, however, is frequently refuted because of data that indicates women, on average, make less compared to men working in the same fields, namely engineering. Therefore, this results in women gravitating towards other fields such as the arts and social sciences where pay rates seem to be more equitable. </p>

<p style="font-size:16px"> It’s also noteworthy that this constant lack of participation in STEM also causes an unintentional “positive” feedback loop where females constantly feel elevated levels of imposter syndrome about competing inside of the classroom with many more males. For example, some will choose not to join those fields, but those who do may also drop out if they’re not performing towards the top of the class. </p>
