<p style="font-size:16px">A lot of us experience massive anxiety at the thought of applying to graduate programs, whether we're aiming for a master's degree or heading for the Ph.D track - even though we've most likely gone through that arduous process previously in undergrad. The main reason for this intimidation is the common stigma of graduate school being <i>hard</i>. Did you know that on average, about 40% of college graduates will earn a master's degree, and that around only 3% will complete their PhD's? When you think about it, these are pretty low numbers, which may be the reason for that self-doubt. Keep in mind, that this is also due to an overall smaller number of applicants.</p>
<p style="font-size:16px"> However, pursuing graduate school is opening up yourself to an entire new type of academic world, with new challenges and projects that will develop you into a fruitful academic and professional. The key is to remember that if you have passion and dedication, you <b>can</b> do it. Here is a check-list of things to consider once you've made the decision to apply for graduate school that will help you succeed and get in where you want through your application submission.

<p style="font-size:16px"><b>Step 1:</b> The first step to your application journey is researching programs that are available in your field of interest and specific universities that offer those programs. Although relevant to any graduate program, finding a school that is an ideal match for you academically and personally is incredibly important for Ph.D. applicants, since this is where you will be spending and dedicating the next 5-6 years of your life. Maybe you want to stay close to home, or the same state, change coasts, or even move to another country. Although location is important, make sure your biggest priority is on the quality of the program, resources, and network. Lastly, the faculty working in your potential department is vital, which brings me to my next point.</p>

<p style="font-size:16px"><b>Step 2:</b> During your research of potential schools, you should mark down professors/PI's (Principal Investigators of a laboratory) who are conducting research and doing work that interests you - namely, work that you could see yourself working on and passionate about. It's crucial to contact these professors beforehand through email and express your interests. This action highlights your motivation and sets you apart from other applicants. Try to set up a meeting (whether over ZOOM or in person) to speak to them and get a feel for their laboratories. Something I also did was contact some of their current PhD students and talked to them about the lab and their respective research projects to get a better idea and build up my knowledge about the work being conducted. Related to this step is also making an effort to attend prospective student days. Many institutions hold prospective student events for various graduate programs, usually in person (although we are still remote for the time being). Register online for these events if they are available and attend them! It is a great opportunity to network with the department and meet lots of people from the department who will help guide your journey. </p>

<p style="font-size:16px"><b>Step 3:</b> Once you've got a list down of schools and potential PI's you'd want to work with, it's time to start compiling relevant stuff you will need for your application. This includes things like having your GRE (or relevant) test scores, access to PDF's of your transcripts, and your résumé/CV. It will be helpful and important to have these on hand when manually entering data or being asked to upload documents.

<p style="font-size:16px"><b>Step 4:</b> The key to securing an admittance to your goal graduate program is one thing: having a clear idea of <i>what</i> you want to accomplish, and <i>how</i> your graduate degree will help you on the path towards it. When asked by graduate school advisors and committees what part of an applicant's degree is probably the most crucial, many will answer with the words "personal statement".  
That sounds pretty vague, but questions to answer on your</p>
