<h3>About Me</h3>
<p style="font-size:14px"> I am a Biomedical Engineering graduate student at the University of Southern California (USC) in Los Angeles. I specialize in Biomedical Data Sciences and enjoy working with data and computer programming in a Biological context. My background is a testament to my passion of being involved with patient health not only from a technical standpoint but also with a rich clinical understanding of the healthcare sector. </p>
