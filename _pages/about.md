<h2>About Me</h2>
<hr>
<p style="font-size:16px"> I am a graduate student studying Bioengineering at the University of Southern California (USC) in Los Angeles. I enjoy working with Biological data and systems through programming, mathematics and machine learning. My background is a testament to my passion of medicine not only from a technical standpoint but also with a rich clinical understanding of the healthcare and patient sector. </p>
