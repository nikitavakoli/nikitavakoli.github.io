  I'm a graduate student at the University of Southern California studying
  Biomedical Engineering with an emphasis in Data Analytics. I'm currently
  a Data Science Intern in the tech hub of Santa Monica, CA and and also
  involved with STEM outreach through USC's Engineering faculty in the
  greater LA area.
  I'm LA born and raised, and completed my undergraduate studies
  at UCLA in 2018.
