<h2 class="remove-whitespace">A little bit about me </h2>
<p style="font-size:16px"> I am a highly enthusiastic graduate student, researcher and aspiring scientist. Currently, I am pursuing my Ph.D. at the <font color="darkred"><b>University Southern California</font></b> Viterbi School in <a href="https://bme.usc.edu/">Biomedical Engineering</a>. I am also finishing up my M.S. in Biomedical Engineering at USC, and completed my undergraduate studies at the <font color="steelblue"><b>University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA)</b></font> where I was a <a href="https://prospective-ugstudents-ucla.academicworks.com/opportunities/284">Regent's Scholar</a>.

<p style="font-size:16px">I enjoy working with data through programming, mathematics, and machine learning. I am primarily interested in the field of <a href="http://mathematical-oncology.org">Mathematical Oncology</a> and learning how to model and understand cancer initiation, progression and developing targeted therapies.

<p style="font-size:16px"> My previous experience highlights not only my technical skills but also a broader perspective of the clinical sector, essential in becoming a successful biomedical engineer. I am currently conducting directed research in the <a href="http://csbl.usc.edu/"> USC CSBL</a> where I am reproducing results and working on designing mathematical model perturbations that affect colorectal cancer cell metabolism. I also enjoy working as a teaching assistant and course producer for various classes in BME as I intend to plan a career in academic research after my PhD. In 2020, I also worked as a data science intern where I developed/advanced my data analysis & visualization skills in Python and Cloud Computing. Prior to graduate school, I worked as a neurofeedback intern at the <a href="http://peakbraininstitute.com/">Peak Brain Institute</a> and as a clinical intern at the <a href="https://www.uclahealth.org/reagan/">UCLA hospital</a> where I gained first-hand experience of clinically administered biotechnology.</p>

<p style="font-size:16px"> I am also enthusiastic about science outreach, particularly in strengthening and inspiring STEM participation in groups that are underrepresented minorities and girls. I have been working at the <a href="https://viterbik12.usc.edu/"> USC Viterbi K-12 STEM Center</a> since 2019, where I am a student instructor/organizer and teach after-school programs centered in Mathematics & Science in the greater Los Angeles community.
