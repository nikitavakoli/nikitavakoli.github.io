<h2>About Me</h2>
<hr>
<p style="font-size:16px"> I am a graduate student at the University of Southern California pursuing my PhD in Biomedical Engineering. I enjoy working with Biological data and systems through programming, mathematics and machine learning. I am primarily interested in Mathematical Oncology and learning how to model cancer initiation, progression and treatment. </p>
