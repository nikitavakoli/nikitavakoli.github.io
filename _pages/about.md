<h2 class="remove-whitespace">A little bit about me </h2>
<p style="font-size:16px"> I am currently pursuing my Ph.D. at the <b><font color="darkred">University Southern California</font></b> Viterbi School of Engineering in <a href="https://bme.usc.edu/">Biomedical Engineering</a>. I completed my M.S. in Biomedical Engineering at USC and my undergraduate studies at the <b><font color="steelblue">University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA)</font></b> where I was a <a href="https://prospective-ugstudents-ucla.academicworks.com/opportunities/284">Regent's Scholar</a>. I was also born in Los Angeles and raised nearby, so I have deep LA roots!

<p style="font-size:16px">My passion is bridging the gap between biology, mathematics and computer scince - three displicines I'm super passionate about. Primarily, I am interested in the field of <a href="http://mathematical-oncology.org">Mathematical Oncology</a> which focuses on mathematically modeling and understanding tumor initiation, progression and personalized patient therapy. My lab a href="http://csbl.usc.edu/"> (USC CSBL) </a> uses a systems biology approach to understand complex biological mechanisms that take place during cancer to then create more accurate and detailed models.

<p style="font-size:16px">Aside from research, I enjoy working as a teaching assistant and course producer for various classes in Biomedical Engineering. In 2020, I also worked as a data science intern where I worked in data analysis & visualization skills in Python and Cloud Computing under the VP of Software Engineering. Prior to graduate school, I worked as a neurofeedback intern at the <a href="http://peakbraininstitute.com/">Peak Brain Institute</a> and as a clinical intern at the <a href="https://www.uclahealth.org/reagan/">UCLA hospital</a> where I gained first-hand experience of clinically administered biotechnology on patients in units such as the ER, ICU and Oncology. </p>

<p style="font-size:16px"> As an engineering student, I possess technical skills that allow me to work productively with data and conduct meaningful research. I mainly program in Python and MATLAB, although I also have some experience with C for high-performance computing, and SQL. I have also taught myself HTML5/CSS3 for web development. My coursework during my undergraduate and graduate career spans from core classes in Mathematics, the Sciences, and Biomedical Engineering.
<hr>
<p style="font-size:16px"> I am also enthusiastic about science outreach, particularly in strengthening and inspiring STEM participation in groups that are underrepresented minorities and girls. I have been working at the <a href="https://viterbik12.usc.edu/"> USC Viterbi K-12 STEM Center</a> since 2019, where I am a student instructor/organizer teaching after-school & summer programs centered in Mathematics & Science in the greater Los Angeles community. This work is extremely important to me as these programs drive inclusivity and equity through greater STEM involvement in young students in the Los Angeles school district. This ultimately results in greater diversity going forward in Engineering which has long been an issue in this field. </p>
