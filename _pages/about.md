<p style="font-size:16px"> I am currently pursuing my Ph.D. at the <b><font color="darkred">University Southern California</font></b> Viterbi School of Engineering in <a href="https://bme.usc.edu/">Biomedical Engineering</a>. I completed my M.S. in Biomedical Engineering at USC and my undergraduate studies at the <b><font color="steelblue">University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA)</font></b> where I was a <a href="https://prospective-ugstudents-ucla.academicworks.com/opportunities/284">Regent's Scholar</a>. I was also born in Los Angeles and raised nearby, so I have deep LA roots!

<p style="font-size:16px">My passion is bridging the gap between biology, mathematics and computer science - three displicines I'm super passionate about. Primarily, I am interested in the field of <a href="http://mathematical-oncology.org">Mathematical Oncology</a> which focuses on mathematically modeling and understanding tumor initiation, progression and personalized patient therapy. My lab, the <a href="http://csbl.usc.edu/"> USC CSBL</a>, uses a systems biology approach to understand complex biological mechanisms that take place during cancer to then create more accurate and detailed models.

<p style="font-size:16px">Aside from research, I enjoy working as a teaching assistant and course producer for various classes in Biomedical Engineering. In 2020, I was a data science intern where I worked in data analysis & visualization skills using Python and Cloud Computing. Prior to graduate school, I worked as a neurofeedback intern at the <a href="http://peakbraininstitute.com/">Peak Brain Institute</a> and as a clinical intern at the <a href="https://www.uclahealth.org/reagan/">UCLA hospital</a> where I gained first-hand experience of clinically administered biotechnology on patients in units such as the ER, ICU and Oncology. </p>

<p style="font-size:16px"> I am also enthusiastic about science outreach, particularly in strengthening and inspiring STEM identity in females and underrepresented minority groups. I have been working at the <a href="https://viterbik12.usc.edu/"> USC Viterbi K-12 STEM Center</a> since 2019, where I am a student instructor/organizer for after-school & summer programs centered in Mathematics & Science. This work is extremely important to me as these programs drive inclusivity and equity through greater STEM involvement in young students in the LAUSD. This ultimately results in greater diversity going forward in Engineering which has longly been an issue in this field. Being involved in organizations on campus such as <a href="https://wise.usc.edu/">WiSE</a> also provides the opportunity to bring together females across all science and engineering disciplines at USC to forge connections and build a strong community on campus.</p>
