<h3> I am currently a Bioengineering graduate student at the University of Southern California (USC). I specialize and am interested in Biomedical Data Sciences. I have a strong passion for working with data and computer programming, especially in a Biological context. Click here for a PDF of my <a href="/images/My_Resume_NT.pdf">Résumé.</a></h3>


<h3><u>Experience</u></h3>
<h4><b>Leaf Group Ltd.</b>
<br>
Santa Monica, CA
<br>
Nov 2019 - May 2020</h4>
<h5>•Used the Google BigQuery API to reduce over 10 million rows of JSON data down into hundreds that would best satisfy requirements for improving site traffic and position on Google. I then trained this data using a prediction model that I built and tested. The overall increase in traffic led to several webpages being changed for performance improvement through Mongo.
<br>
•Performed web scraping from various sources to help create interactive charts and maps for company websites using several visualization libraries.</h5>
<h4><strong>USC Keck School of Medicine</strong>
<br>
Los Angeles, CA
<br>
Jun 2019 - Aug 2019</h4>
<h5>•	Conducted research in the Department of Molecular Microbiology that integrates gene sequencing, bioinformatics pipeline, and statistical analysis to improve HIV vaccine design strategy.
<br>
•	Compiled copious amounts of quantitative research data from previous studies performed on the gut microbiota of HIV patients and co-created a large database in Python to be used for analysis and modeling.</h5>
<h4><strong>Peak Brain Institute</strong>
<br>
Los Angeles, CA
<br>
Jun 2017 - Aug 2019</h4>
<h5>•	Administered electroencephalograms (EEG’s) on patients through the use of EEGr4 software and attachment of a 2-4 channel amplifier and electrodes on the skull to collect brain wave data.
<br>
•	Exported EEG brain maps after editing out unusable and noisy data from the EEG session using proper protocols and created brain charts of abnormal activity for the doctor to utilize in patient appointments.
<br>
•	Conducted neurofeedback trials using neurofeedback software and inputting/monitoring proper frequencies specified by the lead doctor. </h5>
