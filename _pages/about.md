<center><p style="font-size:16px"><i>Thanks for visiting my web portfolio! I'm a 2nd year Ph.D. Student at the University of Southern California studying <b>Biomedical Engineering</b>. I work with Dr. Stacey Finley in the Computational Systems Biology Laboratory. I am passionate about bridging the gap between <b>Biology, Mathematics and Computer Science.</b></i></p>

<b>Research I work on:</b> Cancer-associated fibroblasts have long been known to impact and alter the <font color="tomato"><b>metabolism of colorectal cancer cells</b></font> in the tumor microenvironment. The exact mechanisms and dependencies, however, remain under question. To gain insight into this complex biological mechanism, we implement a <font color="tomato"><b>systems biology approach</b></font> by formulating experimental and metabolomics data in a <font color="tomato"><b>constraint-based model</b></font>. This allows for accurate <font color="tomato"><b>predictions of flux distributions</b></font> in various metabolic pathways. We can also  <font color="tomato"><b>simulate perturbations</b></font> in the model, such as targeted reaction knockdowns that emulate clinical drug administration. These flux predictions are also integrated into PhysiCell, a <font color="tomato"><b>multi-scale systems</b></font> software that allows us to observe 3D constructions of the tumor microenvironment.

<b>Leadership & Campus Involvement:</b> 
As a developing scientist and engineer, I find leadership and networking skills a necessity. As such, I am involved in several different organizations and programs actively on my campus: <br>
<font size="-0.5"><b>Viterbi Graduate Student Association (VGSA).</b> VGSA is a student-run student council catered to the graduate students within the school of engineering. I serve as a BME senator where I help organize and run events in collaboration with other departments and as a whole. I also serve as a VGSA representative on the USC Graduate Student Government (GSG), where I have a similar role but on a larger scale with the entire graduate student body at USC.  <br>
