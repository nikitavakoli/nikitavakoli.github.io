<h2 class="remove-whitespace">A little bit about me </h2>
<p style="font-size:16px"> I am an enthusiastic graduate student/researcher and aspirating future scientist. Currently, I am pursuing my Ph.D. at the University Southern California Viterbi School in <a href="https://bme.usc.edu/">Biomedical Engineering</a>. I am also finishing up my M.S. in Biomedical Engineering at USC, and completed my undergraduate studies at the University of California, Los Angeles where I was a <a href="https://prospective-ugstudents-ucla.academicworks.com/opportunities/284">Regent's Scholar</a>.
<hr>
<p style="font-size:16px">I enjoy working with data through programming, mathematics, and machine learning. I am primarily interested in the field of <a href="http://mathematical-oncology.org">Mathematical Oncology</a> and learning how to model and understand cancer initiation, progression and developing targeted therapies.

<p style="font-size:16px"> My previous experience highlights not only my technical skills but also with a broader perspective of the clinical sector when it comes to becoming a successful biomedical engineer.</p>
