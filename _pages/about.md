# Experience

## Data Science Intern
### Leaf Group Ltd. | Santa Monica, CA
#### Nov 2019 - May 2020

* Used the Google BigQuery API to reduce over 10 million rows of JSON data down into hundreds that would best satisfy requirements for improving site traffic and position on Google. I then trained this data using a prediction model that I built and tested. The overall increase in traffic led to several webpages being changed for performance improvement through Mongo.

* Performed web scraping from various sources to help create interactive charts and maps for company websites using several visualization libraries.

## Graduate Student Researcher

### Keck School of Medicine of USC | Los Angeles, CA

#### Jun 2019 - Aug 2019

* Conducted research in the Department of Molecular Microbiology that integrates gene sequencing, bioinformatics pipeline, and statistical analysis to improve HIV vaccine design strategy.

* Compiled copious amounts of quantitative research data from previous studies performed on the gut microbiota of HIV patients and co-created a large database in Python to be used for analysis and modeling.
