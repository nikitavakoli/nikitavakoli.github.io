<center><p style="font-size:16px"><i>Thanks for visiting my web portfolio! I'm a 2nd year Ph.D. Student at the University of Southern California studying <b>Biomedical Engineering</b>. I work with Dr. Stacey Finley in the Computational Systems Biology Laboratory. I am passionate about bridging the gap between <b>Biology, Mathematics and Computer Science.</b></i></p>

<b>Research I work on:</b> Cancer-associated fibroblasts have long been known to impact and alter the <font color="tomato"><b>metabolism of colorectal cancer cells</b></font> in the tumor microenvironment. The exact mechanisms and dependencies, however, remain under question. To gain insight into this complex biological mechanism, we implement a <font color="tomato"><b>systems biology approach</b></font> by formulating experimental and metabolomics data in a <font color="tomato"><b>constraint-based model</b></font>. This allows for accurate <font color="tomato"><b>predictions of flux distributions</b></font> in various metabolic pathways. We can also  <font color="tomato"><b>simulate perturbations</b></font> in the model, such as targeted reaction knockdowns that emulate clinical drug administration. These flux predictions are also integrated into PhysiCell, a <font color="tomato"><b>multi-scale systems</b></font> software that allows us to observe 3D constructions of the tumor microenvironment.

<b>Leadership & Campus Involvement:</b> 
As a developing scientist and engineer, I find leadership and networking skills a necessity. As such, I am involved in several different organizations and programs actively on my campus: <br>
<font size="-0.75"><b><font color="darkred">Viterbi Graduate Student Association (VGSA).</font></b> <a href="https://vgsa.usc.edu/">VGSA</a> is a student-run student council catered to the graduate students within the school of engineering. I serve as a BME senator where I help organize and run events in collaboration with other departments and as a whole. I also serve as a VGSA representative on the USC Graduate Student Government <a href="https://gsg.usc.edu/">(GSG)</a>, where I have a similar role but on a larger scale with the entire graduate student body at USC.  <br>
<b><font color="darkred">Convergent STEM (cSTEM).</font></b> The USC Michelson Center houses several research laboratories in science, engineering, technology and mathematics. Because of the large range of different majors and research in our building, some fellow PhD students and I began this organization to facilitate building-wide events and seminars to forge better connections and fill knowledge gaps between PhD students. <br>
<b><font color="darkred">Women in Engineering (WiE).</font></b> <a href="https://linktr.ee/uscviterbiwie">WiE</a> at USC is dedicated to offering various opporunities to the women in the engineering school. I participate in the mentorship program to help younger students navigate their paths going forward in Biomedical Engineering. <br>
<b><font color="darkred">Viterbi K-12 STEM Center.</font></b> The <a href="https://viterbik12.usc.edu/">USC K-12 STEM</a> Center provides equitable and enriching programs and opportunities to the greater Los Angeles Commmunity. The goal is to strengthen STEM identity in underrepresented minority groups and girls. I've been working at the center since 2019, serving as an after-school science instructor for both elementary and high school students.
