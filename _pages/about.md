<h2 class="remove-whitespace">A little bit about me </h2>
<p style="font-size:16px"> I am an enthusiastic graduate student/researcher and aspirating future scientist. Currently, I am pursuing my Ph.D. at the University Southern California Viterbi School in <b><a href="https://bme.usc.edu/">Biomedical Engineering</a></b>. I enjoy working with data through programming, mathematics, and machine learning. I am primarily interested in the field of <a href="http://mathematical-oncology.org">Mathematical Oncology</a> and learning how to model and understand cancer initiation, progression and developing targeted therapies.
