<p style="font-size:20"> I am currently a Bioengineering graduate student at the University of Southern California (USC). I specialize and am interested in Biomedical Data Sciences. I enjoy working with data and computer programming, especially in a Biological context. My background is a testament to my passion of being involved with patient health not only from a technical standpoint but also with a rich clinical understanding of the healthcare sector. </p>
