<h2 class="remove-whitespace">A little bit about me </h2>
<p style="font-size:16px"> I am a highly enthusiastic graduate student, researcher and aspiring scientist. Currently, I am pursuing my Ph.D. at the University Southern California Viterbi School in <a href="https://bme.usc.edu/">Biomedical Engineering</a>. I am also finishing up my M.S. in Biomedical Engineering at USC, and completed my undergraduate studies at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) where I was a <a href="https://prospective-ugstudents-ucla.academicworks.com/opportunities/284">Regent's Scholar</a>.
<hr>
<p style="font-size:16px">I enjoy working with data through programming, mathematics, and machine learning. I am primarily interested in the field of <a href="http://mathematical-oncology.org">Mathematical Oncology</a> and learning how to model and understand cancer initiation, progression and developing targeted therapies.

<p style="font-size:16px"> My previous experience highlights not only my technical skills but also with a broader perspective of the clinical sector that is essential to becoming a successful biomedical engineer. I am currently conducting directed research in the <a href="http://csbl.usc.edu/"> USC CSBL</a> where I am reproducing results and working on designing mathematical model perturbations that affect colorectal cancer cell metabolism. Concurrently, I enjoy working as a teaching assistant and course producer for various classes in BME. In 2020, I also worked as a data science intern where I developed/advanced my data analysis & visualization skills. Prior to graduate school, I worked a clinical intern at a neurofeedback facility and also interned at the UCLA hospital in departments such as the ICU and ER where I learned how a hospital operates.</p>
