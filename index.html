<h2 class="remove-whitespace">Welcome!</h2>
 I'm a PhD student studying Biomedical Enginnering at the <b><font color="darkred">University Southern California</font></b> Viterbi School of Engineering.
I completed my M.S. (also at USC) in 2021 and my B.A. from the <b><font color="steelblue">University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA)</font></b> in 2018. 
<hr>
I work in the Computational Systems Biology Laboratory <a href="https://csbl.usc.edu/">(CSBL)</a> and am passionate about
the subfield of Mathematical Oncology, which is the unification of applied mathematics and computational frameworks to gain insights
into cancer mechanisms, progression, and targeted patient therapy.
