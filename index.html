<h2 class="remove-whitespace">Welcome!</h2>
 I'm a PhD student studying Biomedical Enginnering at the University of Southern California.
I work in the Computational Systems Biology Laboratory <a href="https://csbl.usc.edu/">(CSBL)</a> and am passionate about
the subfield of Mathematical Oncology, which is the unification of applied mathematics and computational frameworks to gain insights
into cancer mechanisms, progression, and targeted patient therapy.
