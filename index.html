<h2 class="remove-whitespace">Welcome!</h2>

<p style="font-size:16px"> I'm a PhD student studying Biomedical Enginnering at the <b><font color="darkred">University Southern California</font></b> Viterbi School of Engineering in <a href="https://bme.usc.edu/">Biomedical Engineering</a>.
I work in the Computational Systems Biology Laboratory <a href="https://csbl.usc.edu/">(CSBL)</a> and am passionate about
the subfield of Mathematical Oncology, which is the unification of applied mathematics and computational frameworks to gain insights
into cancer mechanisms, progression, and targeted patient therapy. My collaborative project focuses on utilizing a Systems
Biology approach to elucidate tumor-stromal metabolic crosstalk that occurs between cancer-associated fibroblasts and cancer cells
in the tumor microenvironment <a hrref="https://reporter.nih.gov/project-details/9604967">(NIH U01 grant)</a>.
