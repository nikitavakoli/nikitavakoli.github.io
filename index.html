 I'm a PhD student studying Biomedical Engineering at the University of Southern California. I work in the Computational Systems Biology Laboratory.  
I'm passionate about the subfield of Mathematical Oncology, which is the unification of applied mathematics and computational frameworks to gain insights
into cancer mechanisms, progression, and targeted patient therapy.
