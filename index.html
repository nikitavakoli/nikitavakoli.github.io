<h2 class="remove-whitespace">Welcome </h2>
 I'm a Ph.D. student studying Biomedical Engineering at the University of Southern California. I work in the Computational Systems Biology Laboratory.  <br>
I'm passionate about the subfield of Mathematical Oncology, which is the unification of applied mathematics and computational frameworks to gain insights <br>
into cancer mechanisms, progression, and targeted patient therapy.
