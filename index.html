<h2 class="remove-whitespace">Welcome!</h2>
 I'm a PhD student studying Biomedical Enginnering at the University of Southern California.
I work in the USC Computational Systems Biology Laboratory and am passionate about
the subfield of Mathematical Oncology, which is the unification of applied mathematics and computational frameworks to gain insights
into cancer mechanisms, progression, and targeted patient therapy.
