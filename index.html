<h2 class="remove-whitespace">Welcome!</h2>

<p style="font-size:16px"> I'm a PhD student studying Biomedical Enginnering at the <b><font color="darkred">University Southern California</font></b> Viterbi School of Engineering in <a href="https://bme.usc.edu/">Biomedical Engineering</a>.
I work in the Computational Systems Biology Laboratory <a href="https://csbl.usc.edu/">(CSBL)</a> and am passionate about
the subfield of Mathematical Oncology, which is the unification of applied mathematics and computational frameworks to gain insights
into cancer mechanisms, progression, and targeted patient therapy.
